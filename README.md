Created as tool for use by TriLegion users. TriLegion(built with Node & React) is a 3x3x3 intensive language study system, where learners commit to at least 3 study sessions a week for 3 months at 30 minutes minimum per session with their language partner. Afterwards, they can continue, find another partner, or move on to another language, but they're committed to completing the 90 days. 
TriLegion launch: February 2020. 

This site will allow users to quickly create on-the-fly audio files to create custom phrasebooks, while or after speaking with their language partners. 

Ex:

Text: Cxi tiu estas la lasta fojo.

Language: eo

Filename: LastEO

File created: LastEO.mp3
